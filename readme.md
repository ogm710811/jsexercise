Mars Rover Kata

Introduction

We are sending a rover to Mars and we need to program its movements so that
we can send it commands from Earth.

Basic Information

The rover will have initial starting point (x,y) coordinates (i.e. 0,0)
The rover will have an initial direction (N,E,S,W) to where it is facing
The rover is on a 10 x 10 grid
Implement commands that go forward and backward (f,b)
Implement commands to turn the rover left or right (l,r). The rover just
change the direction it is facing when the user sets this command.
It won't move right or left automatically. To make it change its position,
the user needs to specify the change of direction and then the actual movement.

Iteration 1:-

1) Create an object to represent the rover that has position and
direction attributes
2) Create a grid using arrays (hint: do a google search for two-dimensional
arrays).
3) Write functions for the various commands
4) Try to call some of those functions and display the new position of
the rover.

Iteration 2:-

We want to be able to send a series of commands to the rover and execute
them in sequence.

We will send an array of character commands, which can include:
f for go forward
b for go back
r for turn right*
l for turn left*

The rover just change its direction when we use this command: r and l.

It won't move right or left automatically. To make it go right or left,
the user needs to specify the change of direction and then the actual movement.

So we should be able to tell the rover, for example, ‘fffrfflfffbb’
and it would execute those movements and provide us with its new position.

Furthermore, we need to make sure that the rover never goes off the grid
but rather, wraps from one edge of the grid to another
(planets are spheres after all)

Bonus:

In your 10 x 10 grid, place some obstacles that the rover cannot cross or
land on. Implement obstacle detection. The rover should execute the given
commands until it reaches an obstacle, then stop at the last possible position
and report the obstacle.

Extra hardcore super bonus:
Our rover is lonely! We need to send another one that can roam on the same
grid and execute the same commands. Make sure the rovers don’t bump
into each other.
